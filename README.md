# React + Vite
This is a small project built with React. It uses Material UI as the component library and is mainly designed to help learn and practice React Router.

In this project, several React Router hooks are used to handle routing and navigation. Through this project, I also learned to use a toast notification library called react-hot-toast, which is more user-friendly and visually appealing than the native JavaScript alert.
